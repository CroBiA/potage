You can access the [public POTAGE web server](http://130.56.251.241/potage) which contains a limited number of published gene
expression data sets.

# Running POTAGE locally

You may be interested in running your own POTAGE server if you:

  1. Need to add additional private/proprietary data sets.
  2. Would prefer not to use our public server.

To facilitate this option we have packaged up POTAGE into a Docker image. In order to use this image you will need:

  1. [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for your operating system.
  2. Run the [crobia/potage](https://hub.docker.com/r/crobia/potage/) image.

For full details about running the `crobia/potage` image, please see the [crobia/potage](https://hub.docker.com/r/crobia/potage/) repository on Docker Hub.
